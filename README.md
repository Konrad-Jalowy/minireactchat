# minireactchat

Very simple chat app with React:
- Backend with node and socketio
- Frontend with React framework
- Users connected are counted 
- You can specify user name
- Then you can send messages
- There is only one room
- Messages are displayed like formattedTime username message
- Messages are displayed even before you enter name, but then you cant send anything
- Names of the users are listed
- Names and user count are removed when user disconnects
- Users and their count are stored in RAM (basically its like storing them in Redis but lets not overcomplicate things)
- Messages are stored as state

Basically its simple project in which i try to exercise:
- Using socket io im new to 
- Mixing node backends with React frontends in one projects, connecting things like that

There will be more projects and better ones, thats just a warmup.  
Project doesnt have any CSS right now. In time i will add some styles, but thats not the point of this project.
